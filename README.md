NOTES: Filenames with *test_* are demo programs for implementation or our methods and the baseline:

- Filenames with *VTAE* demonstrate how our formulations and algorithm work
-- "mo" stands for minimizing overlap
-- filenames without "mo" but have "VTAE" demonstrate how our algorithm 1 works.

- Filename with *DTDM-cof* stands for our implementation of the cover-or-forget relaxation of DTDM from paper ["The Cluster Description Problem - Complexity Results, Formulations and Approximations" by I. Davidson et al.](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7857-the-cluster-description-problem-complexity-results-formulations-and-approximations). This serves as our baseline in our experiments.
